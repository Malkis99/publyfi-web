    lore: 'There are whispers of a fourth status — a frequency that does not appear in any official codebase. The system recognizes it only in static, a flicker between frames.\n\nLong ago, one user claimed to have found it. Their username vanished from the chain, leaving behind corrupted packets that loop endlessly in the archives. The fragments form a pattern when decoded: an eye that blinks once every thousand blocks.\n\nThe VIP Case has been seen — once. Some say it reflects nothing, consuming everything that approaches. Others believe it moves on its own within the system, rewriting filenames like a living anomaly.\n\nCollectors trade fragments of code said to originate from the case, though each attempt to analyze them ends in recursion — as if the data remembers being watched.\n\nThe Null Horizon does not grant power. It reveals what remains when power is gone.',
