# Security Framework

## 1. Data Protection & Privacy
PublyFi places user trust and data security at its core.

**Core Principles:**
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** chats, messages, streams fully encrypted
*   **Multi-Layer Security:** data encrypted on-chain & at server level
*   **Minimal Storage:** only essential data retained (GDPR-compliant)
*   **Continuous Audits:** penetration testing and code reviews

> Users retain control, safety, and confidence while building their digital identity.

## 2. KYC & Account Verification
A progressive KYC system balancing accessibility and safety.

**Principles:**
*   Frictionless onboarding (guest access)
*   Tiered unlocks (Prime, Pro)
*   Verified via secure, GDPR-compliant providers

**Levels:**
*   **L0 (Free):** basic guest, view-only
*   **L1 (Prime):** email/phone, unlocks Prime & light trading
*   **L2 (Pro):** ID + FaceID, unlocks quests, NFT trading, monetization
*   **VIP Protection:** MFA, hardware keys, IP whitelist, priority support

> Low entry, high security — scaling trust with user engagement.

## 3. Anti-Farm & Anti-Bot System
A multi-layer defense preserving fairness and sustainability.

*   **AI Monitoring:** session length, clicks, automation detection
*   **Identity Protection:** IP, device fingerprint, wallet linking
*   **Restrictions:** KYC-gated monetization, reviewed transfers

**Penalty Ladder:**
1.  1st: warning
2.  2nd: freeze & re-verification
3.  3rd: DAO ban vote

> Ensures real engagement and fair rewards.

## 4. Content Moderation & Warning System
Hybrid AI + DAO model ensuring safety and freedom.

*   **AI Scanning:** streams, chats, voice (ASR, OCR, CV, NLP)
*   **Penalty Scale:**
    *   +20% soft (mild)
    *   +50% hard (toxic/harassment)
    *   100% = mute/suspension
*   **Compliance Gauge:** visible in real-time (Yellow → Red)
*   **Reputation Impact:** violations reduce trust level
*   **DAO Review:** community handles appeals

> Transparent, fair, and self-correcting moderation.

## 5. Fair Economy Protection
Ensures a balanced, anti-speculative economy.

**Measures:**
*   7-day NFT cooldown (anti-pump)
*   Quest caps (anti-farm)
*   Reward limits per tier

**Stability Tools:**
*   Voluntary burns (bonuses, cosmetics)
*   Fee burn pool (steady supply reduction)
*   Annual halving ×1.5

> Transparent rules via smart contracts, DAO oversight, sustainable tokenomics.

## 6. Moderation & DAO Governance
*   Combines AI automation + community governance
*   DAO votes on standards and penalties
*   High-rep users = stronger influence
*   All actions logged on-chain

> Fair, transparent, and evolving with the community.

## 7. Streamer & Moderator Reputation
Reputation is trust currency in PublyFi.

*   Evaluated via conduct, feedback, history
*   High rep = premium access, sponsorships
*   Low rep = reduced visibility

**Metrics:** warning history, community feedback, DAO votes
**Incentives:** visibility, creation rights, event access

> Merit-based progression ensures integrity and growth.
