# Security Framework

This document outlines PublyFi's multi-layered security framework, covering data protection, account verification, anti-abuse systems, and content moderation to ensure a safe and fair platform for all users.

## 1. Data Protection & Privacy
PublyFi places user trust and data security at its core.

**Core Principles:**
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** Chats, messages, and streams are fully encrypted.
*   **Multi-Layer Security:** Data is encrypted on-chain and at the server level.
*   **Minimal Storage:** Only essential data is retained, in compliance with `GDPR`.
*   **Continuous Audits:** Regular penetration testing and code reviews are conducted.

> Users retain control, safety, and confidence while building their digital identity.

## 2. KYC & Account Verification
A progressive `KYC` system balances accessibility and safety.

**Principles:**
*   Frictionless onboarding is provided for guest access.
*   Tiered unlocks are available for `Prime` and `Pro` status.
*   Verification is handled via secure, `GDPR`-compliant providers.

**Levels:**
*   **L0 (Free):** Provides basic guest access for view-only purposes.
*   **L1 (Prime):** Requires email/phone verification and unlocks `Prime` features and light trading.
*   **L2 (Pro):** Requires ID and `FaceID` verification, unlocking quests, `NFT` trading, and monetization.
*   **VIP Protection:** Includes `MFA`, hardware keys, `IP` whitelisting, and priority support.

> Low entry, high security — scaling trust with user engagement.

## 3. Anti-Farm & Anti-Bot System
A multi-layer defense preserves fairness and sustainability.

*   **AI Monitoring:** Includes session length, clicks, and automation detection.
*   **Identity Protection:** Involves `IP`, device fingerprint, and wallet linking.
*   **Restrictions:** Include `KYC`-gated monetization and reviewed transfers.

**Penalty Ladder:**
1.  **First Offense:** A warning is issued.
2.  **Second Offense:** The account is frozen pending re-verification.
3.  **Third Offense:** A `DAO` ban vote is initiated.

> Ensures real engagement and fair rewards.

## 4. Content Moderation & Warning System
A hybrid `AI` and `DAO` model ensures safety and freedom.

*   **AI Scanning:** Scans streams, chats, and voice (`ASR`, `OCR`, `CV`, `NLP`).
*   **Penalty Scale:**
    *   `+20%` for soft violations (mild).
    *   `+50%` for hard violations (toxic/harassment).
    *   `100%` results in a mute or suspension.
*   **Compliance Gauge:** Is visible in real-time, moving from `Yellow` to `Red`.
*   **Reputation Impact:** Violations reduce a user's trust level.
*   **DAO Review:** The community handles appeals.

> Transparent, fair, and self-correcting moderation.

## 5. Fair Economy Protection
This system ensures a balanced, anti-speculative economy.

**Measures:**
*   A 7-day `NFT` cooldown prevents pump-and-dump schemes.
*   Quest caps prevent farming.
*   Reward limits are in place per tier.

**Stability Tools:**
*   Voluntary burns are available for bonuses and cosmetics.
*   A fee burn pool ensures a steady supply reduction.
*   An annual halving of `×1.5` is implemented.

> Transparent rules via smart contracts, DAO oversight, and sustainable tokenomics.

## 6. Moderation & DAO Governance
*   This combines `AI` automation with community governance.
*   The `DAO` votes on standards and penalties.
*   High-reputation users have stronger influence.
*   All actions are logged on-chain for transparency.

> Fair, transparent, and evolving with the community.

## 7. Streamer & Moderator Reputation
Reputation is the trust currency in PublyFi.

*   It is evaluated via conduct, feedback, and history.
*   High reputation grants premium access and sponsorships.
*   Low reputation results in reduced visibility.

**Metrics:** Includes warning history, community feedback, and `DAO` votes.
**Incentives:** Include visibility, creation rights, and event access.

> Merit-based progression ensures integrity and growth.

## Summary
PublyFi merges security, compliance, and fairness into every layer. Users onboard safely, creators operate confidently, and the economy remains stable — all governed by transparent, community-driven systems.
