# Security Framework

This document outlines PublyFi's multi-layered security framework, covering data protection, account verification, anti-abuse systems, and content moderation to ensure a safe and fair platform for all users.

## 1. Data Protection & Privacy
PublyFi places user trust and data security at its core.

**Core Principles:**
*   **End-to-End Encryption:** chats, messages, and streams are fully encrypted.
*   **Multi-Layer Security:** data is encrypted on-chain and at the server level.
*   **Minimal Storage:** only essential data is retained, in compliance with `GDPR`.
*   **Continuous Audits:** regular penetration testing and code reviews.

> Users retain control, safety, and confidence while building their digital identity.

## 2. KYC & Account Verification
A progressive `KYC` system balances accessibility and safety.

**Principles:**
*   Frictionless onboarding for guest access.
*   Tiered unlocks for `Prime` and `Pro` status.
*   Verification via secure, `GDPR`-compliant providers.

**Levels:**
*   **L0 (Free):** basic guest, view-only.
*   **L1 (Prime):** email/phone, unlocks `Prime` features & light trading.
*   **L2 (Pro):** ID + `FaceID`, unlocks quests, `NFT` trading, and monetization.
*   **VIP Protection:** `MFA`, hardware keys, `IP` whitelist, and priority support.

> Low entry, high security — scaling trust with user engagement.

## 3. Anti-Farm & Anti-Bot System
A multi-layer defense preserves fairness and sustainability.

*   **AI Monitoring:** session length, clicks, and automation detection.
*   **Identity Protection:** `IP`, device fingerprint, and wallet linking.
*   **Restrictions:** `KYC`-gated monetization and reviewed transfers.

**Penalty Ladder:**
1.  **1st:** warning.
2.  **2nd:** freeze & re-verification.
3.  **3rd:** `DAO` ban vote.

> Ensures real engagement and fair rewards.

## 4. Content Moderation & Warning System
A hybrid `AI` + `DAO` model ensures safety and freedom.

*   **AI Scanning:** streams, chats, and voice (`ASR`, `OCR`, `CV`, `NLP`).
*   **Penalty Scale:**
    *   `+20%` soft (mild).
    *   `+50%` hard (toxic/harassment).
    *   `100%` = mute/suspension.
*   **Compliance Gauge:** visible in real-time (`Yellow` → `Red`).
*   **Reputation Impact:** violations reduce trust level.
*   **DAO Review:** community handles appeals.

> Transparent, fair, and self-correcting moderation.

## 5. Fair Economy Protection
Ensures a balanced, anti-speculative economy.

**Measures:**
*   7-day `NFT` cooldown (anti-pump).
*   Quest caps (anti-farm).
*   Reward limits per tier.

**Stability Tools:**
*   Voluntary burns for bonuses and cosmetics.
*   Fee burn pool for steady supply reduction.
*   Annual halving of `×1.5`.

> Transparent rules via smart contracts, DAO oversight, and sustainable tokenomics.

## 6. Moderation & DAO Governance
*   Combines `AI` automation and community governance.
*   `DAO` votes on standards and penalties.
*   High-rep users have stronger influence.
*   All actions are logged on-chain.

> Fair, transparent, and evolving with the community.

## 7. Streamer & Moderator Reputation
Reputation is the trust currency in PublyFi.

*   Evaluated via conduct, feedback, and history.
*   High rep grants premium access and sponsorships.
*   Low rep results in reduced visibility.

**Metrics:** warning history, community feedback, and `DAO` votes.
**Incentives:** visibility, creation rights, and event access.

> Merit-based progression ensures integrity and growth.

## Summary
PublyFi merges security, compliance, and fairness into every layer. Users onboard safely, creators operate confidently, and the economy remains stable — all governed by transparent, community-driven systems.
