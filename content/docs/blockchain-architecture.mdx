# Blockchain Architecture

This document details PublyFi's blockchain infrastructure, including our base network, smart contract ecosystem, multichain model, and the tokenomics of the `$PUBL` token.

## Base Network (Stage 1)
*   **L2:** `Immutable zkEVM` (`Polygon CDK`) — fast, low-cost transactions, game-focused, `EVM-compatible`.
*   **Main Token:** `$PUBL` (`ERC-20`).
*   **NFT Standards:** `ERC-721` / `ERC-1155` (equipment, cosmetics, stickers, effects).

### Key Smart Contracts
*   **Token (`PUBL`):** capped supply, pause function, whitelist of approved spender contracts (`Marketplace`, `Escrow`, `Fees Vault`).
*   **Marketplace:** listings, auctions, royalties to creators, platform fees in `$PUBL`.
*   **Creator Quest Escrow:** streamers/brands deposit `$PUBL` → unlocks only after viewer verification → unclaimed funds return automatically.
*   **Prime / Pro Access:**
    *   `Prime`: one-time `$15` → mints `NFT` badge.
    *   `Pro`: `$15`/month → on-chain subscription, grace period, auto-deactivation.
    *   Payments in `fiat` or `$PUBL` (oracle-based pricing).
*   **Case Factory:**
    *   Weekly `Prime Case` (requires activity) → cosmetics, effects (no `$PUBL`).
    *   Rare drop: “1 Month Pro” voucher.
*   **Fees Vault (Buyback & Burn):** collects stablecoins/`ETH` from fees, buys `$PUBL`, and burns.
*   **Reputation / Anti-Bot Oracle:** watch-time, quest clicks, quizzes, `WebAuthn/FaceID` → validates escrow payouts.
*   **Moderation Signals:** on-chain violations affect reputation and quest eligibility.

## Multichain Model

### Supported Networks
*   `Solana`: fast & cheap `NFT` drops, tickets, cosmetics (wrapped `PUBL-SPL`).
*   `Polygon`: `EVM` support, `dApp` integration (wrapped `PUBL-ERC20`).
*   `BNB Chain`: large `GameFi/DeFi` base (wrapped `PUBL-BEP20`).

### Mechanics
*   **Canonical Token:** `$PUBL` on `Immutable zkEVM`.
*   **Bridging:** wrapped `$PUBL` on other chains via `mint/burn`.
*   **NFT Mobility:** mirror or migrate via `burn-to-mint`.
*   **Localized Transactions:** quests run on their native chain.
*   **UI Adaptation:** auto-switch wallet network per chain.

## Tokenomics — $PUBL
*   **Max Supply:** 500,000,000 `$PUBL`
*   **Blockchain:** Multi-chain (`Immutable zkEVM`, `Solana`, `Polygon`, `BNB`)
*   **Type:** `Utility` + `Governance`
*   **Ticker:** `PUBL`

### Main Utilities
*   **Subscriptions:** pay for `Prime` (one-time) / `Pro` (monthly) in `$PUBL`.
*   **Marketplace & Upgrades:** cosmetics, banners, access passes.
*   **Cases & Crafting:** burns `$PUBL` for upgrades.
*   **Quests:** creator deposits → escrow → buy pressure.
*   **Non-inflationary staking:** utility perks only (no emissions).
*   **DAO Governance:** manage parameters, fees, allocations.

### Anti-Inflation Mechanisms
1.  No platform `$PUBL` giveaways — only creator-funded rewards.
2.  Hard token sinks — cosmetics, upgrades, cases burn % of `$PUBL`.
3.  Annual halving — reward reduction per user/quest.
4.  Dynamic anti-overheat fees — increased fees during spikes.
5.  Automated buyback & burn — via `Fees Vault`.
6.  Non-inflationary staking — boosts only, no minting.
7.  Withdrawal throttles — cooldowns, `KYC`, device limits.
8.  Voluntary burns — improve reputation / loot chance.

## Watch-to-Earn Quest Logic
*   Creator deposits (e.g. 5,000 `$PUBL` → 1,000 slots × 5 `$PUBL` each).
*   Viewer must:
    *   Watch stream.
    *   Say code words.
    *   Pass quizzes/polls.
    *   Verify via `WebAuthn` / `FaceID`.
*   Oracle validation ensures only real users receive payouts.
*   Unused funds refunded; 5% fee → `Buyback & Burn`.

## NFT Tiers & Economy
*   **Rarities:** `Common` → `Rare` → `Epic` → `Legendary` → `Mythic`.
*   **Stats:** `EXP`, drop chance, `+0.1% $PUBL` boost (`DAO`-governed caps).
*   **Seasons:** Limited edition collections, tradable post-season.
*   **Crafting:** Combine `NFTs` + `$PUBL` → upgrade rarity (`$PUBL` burned).
*   **Epic Tier:** requires more collectibles for upgrade.

## Subscriptions

### Prime ($15 one-time)
*   3D avatar customization.
*   Weekly `NFT` case.
*   Rank badge & level-up.
*   Required for `Pro` unlock.
*   Reputation access.

### Pro ($15/month)
*   Complete quests → earn `$PUBL` + `NFTs`.
*   Monthly “Pro Case” (higher rarity).
*   Profile rank boost.
*   Extra reputation from clips/reels/quests.
*   Exclusive cosmetics, event access.
*   `KYC` required.

## NFT Customization
*   Armor, skins, weapons → wearable on 3D avatar.
*   Sources: cases, marketplace, quests, events.
*   Styles: Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Military, etc.
*   Tradable: cross-chain (`zkEVM` ⇄ `Solana` ⇄ `BNB`).

## Anti-Farming System
1.  Multi-level `KYC` (`FaceID`, docs via `SumSub`/`Onfido`).
2.  Device binding (unique hash).
3.  Behavioral `AI` (clicks, sessions, speed).
4.  Account creation limits (per `IP`/device/payment).
5.  Proof of Human (minigames, mouse tracking).
6.  Inventory delay (`NFT` trade after 7–14 days).
7.  Economic monitoring (freeze abnormal wallets).
8.  Reputation perks (high rep = better rewards).
9.  Cross-chain spam filters & tx limits.
10. Delayed trading (new rewards locked 7 days).
