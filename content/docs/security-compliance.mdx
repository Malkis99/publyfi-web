# Security & Compliance

PublyFi is built on a foundation of trust, transparency, and regulatory readiness. As a global `Web3` platform merging entertainment with finance, PublyFi ensures every user, partner, and investor participates in a legally sound, secure, and auditable ecosystem.

## 1. Regulatory Alignment
PublyFi adheres to international standards, aligning with:
*   `GDPR` (EU) for full compliance on data protection and user rights.
*   `AML` / `CFT` (`FATF` Guidelines) for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.
*   `KYC` Regulations, with multi-tier verification through trusted providers.
*   Digital Asset Frameworks such as `MiCA` (EU), `FinCEN` (US), `MAS` (SG), and `VARA` (UAE).
*   Data Residency, with servers in compliant jurisdictions and regional backups.

> Continuous legal audits ensure PublyFi adapts to evolving `Web3` regulations globally.

## 2. AML Policy
To prevent misuse and ensure transparency, we implement the following:
*   **Source of Funds:** Verified via `KYC` partner `APIs`.
*   **Transaction Monitoring:** `AI`-driven anomaly detection.
*   **Wallet Screening:** Cross-checked with sanctions lists (`OFAC`, `EU`, `UN`).
*   **Suspicious Activity Reports (`SARs`):** Automated escalation to the compliance team.
*   **Withdrawal Limits:** Tiered by verification level.
*   **Partner Due Diligence:** All integrations are vetted for `AML` adherence.

> PublyFi’s AML engine ensures every transaction is traceable, auditable, and legitimate.

## 3. Legal Structure & DAO Governance
*   The platform operates under a compliant entity with `VASP` registration.
*   A **DAO Wrapper** provides a recognized legal structure for decentralized governance.
*   A **Transparent Treasury** ensures all fund flows are visible on-chain.
*   **Smart Contract Audits** are conducted by independent third-party assessors pre-launch.
*   A **Liability Shield** means `DAO` voting and proposals are governed by on-chain logic.

> A legal-first `DAO` ensures community power within safe jurisdictional boundaries.

## 4. Risk Management
PublyFi implements multi-dimensional risk controls:
*   **Technical Risks:** Mitigated by code audits, redundancy, and bug bounties.
*   **Economic Risks:** Managed through controlled token emissions, a burn policy, and `DAO` oversight.
*   **Operational Risks:** Handled via access controls and segregation of duties.
*   **Counterparty Risks:** Addressed through partner vetting and continuous monitoring.

> Every layer—from code to community—includes built-in risk mitigations.

## 5. Investor & Partner Assurance
For investors and enterprise partners, we provide:
*   **Regular Reporting:** Quarterly transparency reports cover the treasury, users, and emissions.
*   **Audited Financials:** Verified by licensed audit firms.
*   **Compliance Certificates:** Including `KYC`/`AML`, data security, and smart contract verifications.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Governed under local laws with arbitration clauses.

> Institutional-grade compliance ensures sustainable growth.

## 6. Ethical Governance
PublyFi is committed to responsible innovation:
*   **Fair Access:** We employ no pay-to-win mechanics and use transparent reward logic.
*   **User Rights:** We support data portability, deletion, and export on request.
*   **Transparency:** We maintain open-source policies and visible `DAO` decisions.
*   **Equality:** We enforce inclusive content policies with zero discrimination.

> PublyFi doesn’t just meet compliance—it sets new ethical standards for `Web3`.

## Summary
By combining regulatory compliance, legal clarity, and ethical governance, PublyFi ensures that user data and funds are fully protected, the token economy operates transparently, `DAO` governance remains lawful and auditable, and partners and investors can engage with confidence.
