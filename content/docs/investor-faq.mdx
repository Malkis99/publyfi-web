### 1. How do you plan to acquire users?

**Answer:**
Multi-layer growth funnel: referral-based waitlist, landing page with rewards for early users, social progress bar (FOMO).
Content marketing: daily posts (Twitter, Telegram), devlogs, AMAs, teaser art and UI reveals.
Influencers & streamers: partnerships with micro-streamers to create quests and exclusive events.
Gamification: daily and seasonal quests, collectible NFTs and loot cases, in-platform leaderboards.
GameSync integration: connecting external games so players’ progress is synchronized with their PublyFi profile.

### 2. How will you handle bots and farming abuse?

**Answer:**
Multi-layer anti-farming: FaceID/KYC verification, behavioral AI, device fingerprinting, Proof-of-Human mini-games.
Quest Escrow Oracle: streamers deposit tokens into a smart contract; payouts go only to verified users.
Reputation system: higher reputation unlocks better rewards; abuse leads to penalties and bans.
Economic measures: trading delays for newly minted NFTs, dynamic fees during suspicious activity spikes.

### 3. How will you ensure long-term $PUBL token value?

**Answer:**
Annual halving: controls emissions and creates scarcity.
Strong token sinks: crafting, upgrades, loot cases, and customizations burn PUBL.
Buyback & burn: a portion of all platform fees are sent to treasury and burned.
DAO governance: community votes on key economic parameters to adapt to market conditions.
Utility: subscriptions, marketplace transactions, quests, boosts, event participation, and DAO voting.

### 4. Who are your competitors and why are you better?

**Answer:**
Twitch / YouTube: no real rewards or economy for viewers.
Web3 games: often hyper-financialized, inflationary, with poor UX.
PublyFi: a single ecosystem combining streaming, quests, NFTs, social identity, and DAO governance — built on sustainable tokenomics and multichain architecture.

### 5. How does monetization scale?

**Answer:**
Prime: one-time payment providing instant cashflow.
Pro: subscription model creating stable MRR.
Marketplace & Quests: fees on every transaction + incentives for users to buy and spend PUBL.
Cases & Customization: regular drops and NFT upgrades drive ongoing demand.
As DAU grows, revenue scales proportionally, while token scarcity increases through burns and halving.

### 6. What is your exit strategy?

**Answer:**
DAO + liquid token: allows early investors to partially exit on the open market.
M&A potential: PublyFi could become a strategic acquisition target for Immutable, Polygon, or Twitch.
Seed / Series A: targeted for 18–24 months, with 3–5× valuation growth as we scale past 100k+ active users.

### 7. What risks do you see and how are they mitigated?

**Answer:**
Web3 market volatility: diversified revenue streams, multichain strategy.
Bots: advanced anti-farming system + oracle validation.
Regulatory risks: built-in KYC/AML, legal DAO wrappers, GDPR compliance.
Streamer onboarding: early RevShare partnerships and an internal quest studio to bootstrap ecosystem activity.

### 8. How is your architecture built and how scalable is it?

**Answer:**
Infrastructure: runs on Immutable zkEVM for scalability, low gas fees, and Ethereum-level security.
Multichain bridges: Polygon, Solana, and BNB planned for expansion.
Architecture: microservices for modular updates without downtime.
Frontend: Unity-based rendering; supports browser, mobile, and future console deployment.

### 9. How do you protect user data and assets?

**Answer:**
Non-custodial wallets: users fully own their assets.
Encrypted identity layer: user data hashed & stored off-chain with zk-proof validation.
Security audits: performed with external partners before every major release.
Bug bounty program: ensures continuous improvement.

### 10. How do you measure success (KPIs)?

**Answer:**
DAU / WAU growth and retention
Pro subscriber retention & churn rates
Marketplace GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume)
$PUBL token velocity and burn rate
Community engagement (quests completed per user per week)

### 11. How will you scale the team?

**Answer:**
Initial team: 5 core members (tech, product, design, ops).
Hiring plan: grow to 12–15 post-pre-seed (engineering, community, marketing).
Agile cycles: biweekly sprints to ensure roadmap progress.
