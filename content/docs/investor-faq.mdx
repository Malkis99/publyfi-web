# Investor FAQ

This section addresses frequently asked questions from our partners and investors, covering topics from user acquisition and tokenomics to risk mitigation and our long-term vision.

## 1. How do you plan to acquire users?
**Answer:**
*   A multi-layer growth funnel includes a referral-based waitlist, a landing page with rewards for early users, and a social progress bar to create `FOMO`.
*   Content marketing includes daily posts on Twitter and Telegram, Devlogs, `AMAs`, and teaser art and `UI` reveals.
*   Influencer and streamer partnerships with micro-streamers will create quests and exclusive events.
*   Gamification is driven by daily and seasonal quests, collectible `NFTs`, loot cases, and in-platform leaderboards.
*   `GameSync` integration connects external games so players’ progress is synchronized with their PublyFi profile.

## 2. How will you handle bots and farming abuse?
**Answer:**
*   A multi-layer anti-farming system uses `FaceID`/`KYC` verification, behavioral `AI`, device fingerprinting, and `Proof-of-Human` mini-games.
*   The `Quest Escrow Oracle` ensures streamers deposit tokens into a smart contract, and payouts go only to verified users.
*   A reputation system ensures a higher reputation unlocks better rewards, while abuse leads to penalties and bans.
*   Economic measures include trading delays for newly minted `NFTs` and dynamic fees during suspicious activity spikes.

## 3. How will you ensure long-term $PUBL token value?
**Answer:**
*   An annual halving controls emissions and creates scarcity.
*   Strong token sinks, such as crafting, upgrades, loot cases, and customizations, burn `$PUBL`.
*   A buyback and burn mechanism uses a portion of all platform fees, which are sent to the treasury and burned.
*   `DAO` governance allows the community to vote on key economic parameters to adapt to market conditions.
*   Utility is driven by subscriptions, marketplace transactions, quests, boosts, event participation, and `DAO` voting.

## 4. Who are your competitors and why are you better?
**Answer:**
*   `Twitch` and `YouTube` offer no real rewards or economy for viewers.
*   `Web3` games are often hyper-financialized, inflationary, and have poor `UX`.
*   PublyFi provides a single ecosystem combining streaming, quests, `NFTs`, social identity, and `DAO` governance, all built on sustainable tokenomics and a multichain architecture.

## 5. How does monetization scale?
**Answer:**
*   `Prime` is a one-time payment that provides instant cashflow.
*   `Pro` is a subscription model that creates stable `MRR`.
*   Marketplace and `Quests` generate fees on every transaction and incentivize users to buy and spend `$PUBL`.
*   Cases and `Customization` feature regular drops and `NFT` upgrades that drive ongoing demand.
*   As `DAU` grows, revenue scales proportionally, while token scarcity increases through burns and halving.

## 6. What is your exit strategy?
**Answer:**
*   The `DAO` and liquid token allow early investors to partially exit on the open market.
*   `M&A` potential exists, as PublyFi could become a strategic acquisition target for `Immutable`, `Polygon`, or `Twitch`.
*   A Seed / Series A round is targeted for 18–24 months, with 3–5× valuation growth as we scale past 100k+ active users.

## 7. What risks do you see and how are they mitigated?
**Answer:**
*   `Web3` market volatility is mitigated by diversified revenue streams and a multichain strategy.
*   Bots are mitigated by an advanced anti-farming system and oracle validation.
*   Regulatory risks are mitigated by built-in `KYC`/`AML`, legal `DAO` wrappers, and `GDPR` compliance.
*   Streamer onboarding is mitigated by early `RevShare` partnerships and an internal quest studio to bootstrap ecosystem activity.

## 8. How is your architecture built and how scalable is it?
**Answer:**
*   The platform runs on `Immutable zkEVM` for scalability, low gas fees, and `Ethereum`-level security.
*   Multichain bridges to `Polygon`, `Solana`, and `BNB` are planned for expansion.
*   A microservices architecture allows for modular updates without downtime.
*   A `Unity`-based front-end supports browser, mobile, and future console deployment.

## 9. How do you protect user data and assets?
**Answer:**
*   Non-custodial wallets are used by default, so users fully own their assets.
*   An encrypted identity layer hashes and stores user data off-chain with `zk-proof` validation.
*   Security audits are performed with external partners before every major release.
*   A bug bounty program ensures continuous improvement.

## 10. How do you measure success (KPIs)?
**Answer:**
*   `DAU` / `WAU` growth and retention.
*   `Pro` subscriber retention and churn rates.
*   Marketplace `GMV` (Gross Merchandise Volume).
*   `$PUBL` token velocity and burn rate.
*   Community engagement, measured by quests completed per user per week.

## 11. How will you scale the team?
**Answer:**
*   The initial 5 core members cover tech, product, design, and ops.
*   A hiring plan is in place to grow to 12–15 members post-pre-seed, focusing on engineering, community, and marketing.
*   Agile development cycles (biweekly sprints) ensure the roadmap remains on track.
