# Investor FAQ

This section addresses frequently asked questions from our partners and investors, covering topics from user acquisition and tokenomics to risk mitigation and our long-term vision.

## 1. How do you plan to acquire users?
Multi-layer growth funnel: referral-based waitlist, landing page with rewards for early users, and a social progress bar (`FOMO`). We utilize content marketing (daily posts, `AMAs`, devlogs), influencer partnerships, and gamification with daily quests, collectible `NFTs`, and leaderboards. Our `GameSync` integration further expands our reach by connecting external game progress to PublyFi profiles.

## 2. How will you handle bots and farming abuse?
We employ a multi-layer anti-farming system that includes `FaceID`/`KYC` verification, behavioral `AI`, device fingerprinting, and `Proof-of-Human` mini-games. The `Quest Escrow Oracle` ensures streamers' token deposits are only paid out to verified users. A reputation system penalizes abuse, while economic measures like trading delays for new `NFTs` curb suspicious activity.

## 3. How will you ensure long-term $PUBL token value?
Our strategy includes an annual halving to control emissions, strong token sinks (crafting, upgrades, cases burn `$PUBL`), and a buyback & burn program funded by platform fees. The `DAO` governs key economic parameters, while the token's utility across subscriptions, quests, and governance drives organic demand.

## 4. Who are your competitors and why are you better?
Unlike `Twitch` or `YouTube`, we offer a real rewards economy for viewers. Compared to other `Web3` games that are often hyper-financialized with poor `UX`, PublyFi provides a single, sustainable ecosystem combining streaming, quests, `NFTs`, social identity, and `DAO` governance on a robust, multichain architecture.

## 5. How does monetization scale?
Our model combines a one-time `Prime` payment for instant cashflow and a `Pro` subscription for stable `MRR`. Marketplace and quest fees, along with cosmetic sales and `NFT` upgrades, drive ongoing demand for `$PUBL`. As our daily active users (`DAU`) grow, revenue scales proportionally while token scarcity increases through burns and halving.

## 6. What is your exit strategy?
The liquid `$PUBL` token and `DAO` structure allow early investors to partially exit on the open market. PublyFi is also positioned as a strategic acquisition target for major players like `Immutable`, `Polygon`, or `Twitch`. We are targeting a Seed/Series A round in 18–24 months, projecting significant valuation growth as we scale past 100k+ active users.

## 7. What risks do you see and how are they mitigated?
*   **`Web3` Market Volatility:** Mitigated by diversified revenue streams and a multichain strategy.
*   **Bots:** Mitigated by our advanced anti-farming system and oracle validation.
*   **Regulatory Risks:** Mitigated by built-in `KYC`/`AML`, legal `DAO` wrappers, and `GDPR` compliance.
*   **Streamer Onboarding:** Mitigated by early `RevShare` partnerships and an internal quest studio.

## 8. How is your architecture built and how scalable is it?
Our infrastructure runs on `Immutable zkEVM` for scalability, low gas fees, and `Ethereum`-level security, with planned bridges to `Polygon`, `Solana`, and `BNB`. The architecture uses microservices for modular updates, and the `Unity`-based frontend supports browser, mobile, and future console deployment.

## 9. How do you protect user data and assets?
We use non-custodial wallets, giving users full ownership of their assets. Our encrypted identity layer hashes and stores user data off-chain with `zk-proof` validation. We conduct security audits with external partners before every major release and run a bug bounty program.

## 10. How do you measure success (KPIs)?
Our key performance indicators include `DAU`/`WAU` growth and retention, `Pro` subscriber retention & churn rates, marketplace `GMV` (Gross Merchandise Volume), `$PUBL` token velocity and burn rate, and community engagement (quests completed per user per week).

## 11. How will you scale the team?
Our initial core team of 5 will grow to 12–15 post-pre-seed, focusing on engineering, community, and marketing. We operate in agile, biweekly sprints to ensure consistent roadmap progress.
