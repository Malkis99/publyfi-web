# Ecosystem Features

## 1. Marketplace (NFT & Items)
The PublyFi Marketplace is the central hub for digital ownership — where all in-game and social assets become tradeable, collectible, and usable across the platform.

**Key Highlights:**
*   Wide range of assets: weapons, skins, complete sets, customization items, subscription cases, and exclusive collectibles.
*   Dynamic rarity system: Common → Rare → Epic → Legendary → Mythic.
*   Cross-chain support (Immutable zkEVM, Polygon, BNB, Solana) ensuring liquidity and accessibility across ecosystems.
*   Direct profile integration — purchased items can instantly be equipped, used in streams, or displayed in inventories.
*   Token economy synergy — NFTs can be exchanged for $PUBL or used to unlock quests, cases, and premium features.
*   Seasonal & limited drops tied to festivals, collaborations, or esports events.

The Marketplace is not just a store — it is a player-driven economy where every trade or set collected contributes to reputation, progression, and social identity.

## 2. User Profile & Customization
The PublyFi profile is more than a user page — it is a living digital identity that grows with every achievement, quest, and NFT collected.

**Customization Features:**
*   Avatar frames, dynamic profile backgrounds (static & animated)
*   NFT illustrations, collectible banners, exclusive artwork
*   Full-page customization: block layout, themes, and color schemes
*   Integrated activity stats, achievements, and rarity highlights

This transforms the profile into a full-fledged RPG business card — unique, evolving, and socially recognizable.

### 3D Living Character System
Each user owns a unique 3D living avatar that evolves with their level, reputation, and NFT inventory.
*   Armor, weapons, auras, emotes, and backgrounds are all NFTs — equipable, tradable, collectible.
*   Set Bonuses: complete NFT sets unlock exclusive animations, glows, and aura effects.
*   Rarity Gating: higher rarity items require profile progression and milestones.
*   Subscription Perks: Prime & Pro users gain access to exclusive cases and assets.
*   Always live in profile — rotating, emoting, and interactive.
*   GameSync Integration: avatars reflect external game progress for a true cross-platform identity.

In PublyFi, your profile isn’t static — it’s a dynamic showcase of who you are, what you’ve achieved, and how you play.
