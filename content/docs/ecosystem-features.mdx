# Ecosystem Features

This document details the core features of the PublyFi ecosystem, from the `NFT` marketplace and user profiles to our unique `GameSync` system and seasonal events.

## 1. Marketplace (NFT & Items)
The PublyFi Marketplace is the central hub for digital ownership, where all in-game and social assets become tradeable, collectible, and usable across the platform.

**Key Highlights:**
*   A wide range of assets are available, including weapons, skins, complete sets, customization items, subscription cases, and exclusive collectibles.
*   A dynamic rarity system is used: `Common` → `Rare` → `Epic` → `Legendary` → `Mythic`.
*   Cross-chain support (`Immutable zkEVM`, `Polygon`, `BNB`, `Solana`) ensures liquidity and accessibility across ecosystems.
*   Direct profile integration allows purchased items to be instantly equipped, used in streams, or displayed in inventories.
*   Token economy synergy allows `NFTs` to be exchanged for `$PUBL` or used to unlock quests, cases, and premium features.
*   Seasonal and limited drops are tied to festivals, collaborations, or esports events.

The Marketplace is not just a store—it is a player-driven economy where every trade or set collected contributes to reputation, progression, and social identity.

## 2. User Profile & Customization
The PublyFi profile is more than a user page; it is a living digital identity that grows with every achievement, quest, and `NFT` collected.

**Customization Features:**
*   Avatar frames and dynamic profile backgrounds (static & animated) are available.
*   `NFT` illustrations, collectible banners, and exclusive artwork can be displayed.
*   Full-page customization includes block layout, themes, and color schemes.
*   Integrated activity stats, achievements, and rarity highlights are featured.

This transforms the profile into a full-fledged RPG business card—unique, evolving, and socially recognizable.

### 3D Living Character System
Each user owns a unique 3D living avatar that evolves with their level, reputation, and `NFT` inventory.
*   Armor, weapons, auras, emotes, and backgrounds are all `NFTs` that are equipable, tradable, and collectible.
*   Set Bonuses for complete `NFT` sets unlock exclusive animations, glows, and aura effects.
*   Rarity Gating means higher rarity items require profile progression and milestones.
*   Subscription Perks give `Prime` & `Pro` users access to exclusive cases and assets.
*   The avatar is always live in the profile, rotating, emoting, and interactive.
*   `GameSync` Integration allows avatars to reflect external game progress for a true cross-platform identity.

In PublyFi, your profile isn’t static—it’s a dynamic showcase of who you are, what you’ve achieved, and how you play.

## 3. Levels, Reputation & Subscriptions
Progression is built around levels, reputation, and memberships that motivate long-term engagement.

### Levels
*   Every `NFT` and item has a minimum level requirement.
*   Users level up via quests, tournaments, streaming, and platform activity.
*   Higher levels unlock advanced gear, cosmetics, and seasonal items.

### Reputation
*   Reputation reflects fair play, community contribution, and quest achievements.
*   It is gained through verified behavior and endorsements.
*   It unlocks rare `NFTs`, high-tier events, and boosts visibility.

### Subscriptions
*   `Prime` offers one weekly case, unlocked via light activity like watching streams and completing miniquests.
*   `Pro` offers one weekly and one monthly case, with higher drop chances and access to exclusive quests.

Together, levels, reputation, and subscriptions form the core engagement loop: play, progress, personalize.

## 4. NFTs, Cases & Rarity System
Every item in PublyFi feels valuable, collectible, and progression-linked.

### Dynamic Rarity
*   Items exist across `Common`, `Rare`, `Epic`, `Legendary`, and `Mythic` tiers.
*   Higher rarity provides exclusive glows, animations, emotes, and effects.

### Visual & Functional Bonuses
*   `Legendary` and `Mythic` items grant prestige through special auras, highlights, or thematic animations.

### Sets & Collections
*   Full sets (e.g., Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Shooter, Mythic) grant bonuses and recognition.

### Cases
*   `Prime` users receive one weekly case.
*   `Pro` users receive one weekly and one monthly case with boosted drops.
*   Cases contain cosmetics, avatar items, and collab drops.
*   They are available via the Marketplace, quests, and seasonal events.

Every drop is an exciting moment, blending rarity, marketplace integration, and collectible progression.

## 5. NFTs as Internal Value
