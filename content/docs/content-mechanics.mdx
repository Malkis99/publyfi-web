# Content Mechanics

This document explains the core mechanics that power PublyFi's content economy, including content formats, subscription tiers, and the value retention loops that drive engagement.

## 1. Content Formats (Fuel of the Platform)
*   **Streams** are live quests with donations and audience challenges.
*   **Reels** are short, viral gaming clips in a TikTok-style format.
*   **Quests** are streamer-created tasks that offer real rewards.
*   **Community & Events** include tournaments, seasonal drops, guilds, and `IRL` festivals.

## 2. Subscriptions: Access to Content Economy
PublyFi uses a three-tier subscription model:

*   **Free:** Users can view content and explore the marketplace with no rewards.
*   **Prime** (`$15` one-time): Unlocks avatar customization, inventory, profile boosts, and a weekly case earned through minimal activity.
*   **Pro** (`$15`/month, requires `Prime`): Provides full access to all privileges, including:
    *   Completing all quests to earn tokens and `NFTs`.
    *   Participating in `Pro`-only events and tournaments.
    *   Accessing exclusive cosmetics and `DAO` voting power.
    *   Receiving weekly and monthly cases with higher rarity drops.
    *   Joining weekly platform quests and seasonal reward cycles.

**Rules:**
*   Only `Pro` users can complete quests and receive rewards.
*   `Pro` status requires `Prime` to ensure verified identity.

## 3. Interaction Layer (Engine of Engagement)
*   **GameSync Memory:** Every watch, quest, or trade evolves the user's 3D avatar.
*   **NFT Integration:** Rewards are real assets, such as skins, weapons, and profile items.
*   **Social Mechanics:** Likes, follows, collaborations, and `DAO` voting boost a user's reputation.

## 4. Value & Retention (Detailed)
Retention is built around two pillars: **Streamer Quests** and **Platform Quests**.

### Streamer Quests (Core Quests)
*   Created by streamers for their audience.
*   Rewards include `$PUBL` tokens and `NFTs`.
*   These quests drive engagement, loyalty, and monetization.

### Platform Quests (Supportive Quests)
*   Created by PublyFi to sustain engagement.
*   Rewards include `NFTs` such as cosmetics and profile items.
*   Designed for seasonal events and onboarding.
*   They are accessible to both `Prime` and `Pro` users, with `Pro` users having access to higher rarity items.

### Quest Limits (Anti-Farm)
*   Daily and weekly limits are applied per profile.
*   This prevents farming and bots.
*   The limits scale with a user's reputation and tier.

### Monetization Flow
*   Streamers fund quests in `$PUBL`.
*   Users earn rewards upon completion.
*   The platform takes a small fee, which contributes to a buyback and burn mechanism.

### Daily/Seasonal Cycles
*   The platform features daily quests, weekly cases, and seasonal events.
*   This model builds anticipation and encourages consistent user return.

### Reputation & Leaderboards
*   Quest completion leads to higher reputation and better rankings.
*   A higher reputation unlocks rarer items and increases quest limits.

### Creator Economy
Verified streamers can mint and sell stickers, emotes, animated effects, and `NFT` packs.
*   All content passes platform verification.
*   A certain reputation milestone is required.
*   Monthly submission caps are in place.
*   Once approved, items appear in the marketplace.

> Empowers creators with revenue streams and collectible, functional items, forming a creator-driven microeconomy.

### Partner Economy
Brand collaborations bring themed rewards, branded cosmetics, and event-driven quests.
> This ensures additional monetization, external audience growth, and brand synergy.

### Community Mechanics
PublyFi builds community interaction into content:
*   **Guilds & Clans:** Users can complete collective quests.
*   **DAO Governance:** Users can vote on features, `NFTs`, and seasons.
*   **Forums & Discussions:** Users can share strategies, fan art, and memes.
*   **Mentorship:** Users can guide newcomers to earn reputation and `NFTs`.
*   **Invite Bonuses:** Users can earn exclusive cosmetics.
*   **Limited-Time Challenges:** These offer rare rewards and drive `FOMO` engagement.

> Community mechanics make PublyFi a living ecosystem shaped by its users.

## Summary
PublyFi transforms content into a playable economy. Unlike other platforms, every action has value, progression, and verified rewards.
