# Content Mechanics

## 1. Content Formats (Fuel of the Platform)
*   **Streams** — live quests, donations, audience challenges
*   **Reels** — short viral gaming clips (TikTok-style)
*   **Quests** — streamer-created tasks with real rewards
*   **Community & Events** — tournaments, seasonal drops, guilds, IRL festivals

## 2. Subscriptions: Access to Content Economy
PublyFi uses a three-tier subscription model:

*   **Free** — View content, explore marketplace (no rewards)
*   **Prime ($15 one-time)** — Unlock avatar customization, inventory, profile boosts, and a weekly case (earned through minimal activity)
*   **Pro ($15/month, requires Prime)** — Full access to all privileges:
    *   Complete all quests (earn tokens + NFTs)
    *   Participate in Pro-only events and tournaments
    *   Access exclusive cosmetics & DAO voting power
    *   Receive weekly + monthly cases (higher rarity)
    *   Join weekly platform quests and seasonal reward cycles

**Rules:**
*   Only Pro users can complete quests and receive rewards
*   Pro status requires Prime (ensures verified identity)

## 3. Interaction Layer (Engine of Engagement)
*   **GameSync Memory** — every watch, quest, or trade evolves the 3D avatar
*   **NFT Integration** — rewards = real assets (skins, weapons, profile items)
*   **Social Mechanics** — likes, follows, collabs, DAO-voting boost reputation

## 4. Value & Retention (Detailed)
Retention is built around two pillars: **Streamer Quests** and **Platform Quests**.

### Streamer Quests (Core Quests)
*   Created by streamers for their audience
*   Rewards: $PUBL tokens + NFTs
*   Drive engagement, loyalty, monetization

### Platform Quests (Supportive Quests)
*   Created by PublyFi to sustain engagement
*   Rewards: NFTs (cosmetics, profile items)
*   Designed for seasonal events and onboarding
*   Accessible to both Prime and Pro (Pro = higher rarity)

### Quest Limits (Anti-Farm)
*   Daily/weekly limits per profile
*   Prevents farming/bots
*   Scales with reputation and tier

### Monetization Flow
*   Streamers fund quests in $PUBL
*   Users earn via completion
*   Platform takes small fee → buyback & burn

### Daily/Seasonal Cycles
*   Daily quests, weekly cases, seasonal events
*   Builds anticipation and consistent return

### Reputation & Leaderboards
*   Quest completion = higher rep & rankings
*   Reputation unlocks rarer items, higher limits

### Creator Economy
Verified streamers can mint & sell stickers, emotes, animated effects, NFT packs.
*   All content passes platform verification
*   Requires reputation milestone
*   Monthly submission caps
*   Once approved, items appear in marketplace

> Empowers creators with revenue streams and collectible, functional items — forming a creator-driven microeconomy.

### Partner Economy
Brand collaborations bring:
*   Themed rewards
*   Branded cosmetics
*   Event-driven quests

> Ensures additional monetization, external audience growth, and brand synergy.

### Community Mechanics
PublyFi builds community interaction into content:
*   **Guilds & Clans:** complete collective quests
*   **DAO Governance:** vote on features, NFTs, seasons
*   **Forums & Discussions:** share strategies, fan art, memes
*   **Mentorship:** guide newcomers, earn reputation/NFTs
*   **Invite Bonuses:** earn exclusive cosmetics
*   **Limited-Time Challenges:** rare rewards, FOMO engagement

> Community mechanics make PublyFi a living ecosystem shaped by its users.

### Visual Concept (for documentation)
*   Circular loop: Content → Interaction → Rewards → Reputation → More Content
*   Subscription ladder: Free → Prime → Pro (with lock icons)
*   Quest icons: Streamer Quests (tokens + NFTs), Platform Quests (NFT-only)
*   Highlights: Quest limits, Creator verification, Partner programs, Community DAO

### Summary:
PublyFi transforms content into a playable economy.
Unlike Twitch or TikTok, every action has value, progression, and verified rewards.
